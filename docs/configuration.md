# Configuration

Default config path: `./config.yml`

Config precedence:

1. `--config <path>`
2. `./config.yml`
3. Schema defaults

## Minimal Config

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    api_key: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"

agents:
  defaults:
    model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
```

## Providers

Supported provider blocks — see the **[Providers overview](providers.md)** for a full comparison.

- **[`anthropic`](anthropic.md)** — Claude models via Messages API
- **[`openai`](openai.md)** — GPT-5 family, o3 models
- **[`deepseek`](deepseek.md)** — DeepSeek-V3, R1
- **[`groq`](groq.md)** — Ultra-fast inference (Llama, Mixtral, Gemma)
- **[`gemini`](gemini.md)** — Google Gemini Pro, Flash
- **[`openrouter`](openrouter.md)** — Gateway to hundreds of models
- **[`bedrock`](bedrock.md)** — AWS Bedrock via Converse API
- **[`vllm`](vllm.md)** — Local/hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Voice Transcription

Voice notes are transcribed with the Whisper API. By default the key is reused from the chat provider config, Groq first (`whisper-large-v3-turbo`), then OpenAI (`whisper-1`). The `transcription` section changes that per bot:

```yaml
transcription:
  enabled: true              # false: voice notes are never transcribed
  provider: groq             # openai or groq; default picks groq, then openai
  model: whisper-large-v3    # optional; overrides the provider default
  api_key: "${WHISPER_KEY}"  # own key, separate from the chat provider
```

`model` is passed to the provider as given. Groq serves `whisper-large-v3-turbo` (the default, fastest and cheapest) and `whisper-large-v3`, which is slower but transcribes long or noisy recordings more accurately.

With `enabled: false`, or when no key is available, a voice note is saved to the inbox without a transcript and the bot replies that it could not hear it, without a model turn. `autobot doctor` prints the provider in use, whether it runs on its own key, and warns when a pinned provider has no key.

## Media

Incoming files are saved to an inbox under the workspace so tools can read them by path. Only the location is configurable:

```yaml
media:
  inbox: inbox   # relative to the workspace (default), or an absolute path
```

A voice note recorded in the chat by the sender is treated as their spoken words. Audio files, photos, documents and anything forwarded become attachments and never enter the message text. See [Media support](media.md).

## Channels

**Security Note:** `allow_from` is deny-by-default for security.

Setup guides: **[Telegram](telegram.md)** | **[Slack](slack.md)** | **[Zulip](zulip.md)**

```yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    enabled: false
    token: ""
    # allow_from options:
    # []              - DENY ALL (secure default)
    # ["*"]           - Allow anyone (use with caution)
    # ["@user", "id"] - Allowlist specific users (recommended)
    allow_from: []
    topics: []     # forum topic IDs the bot answers in without a mention

  slack:
    enabled: false
    bot_token: ""
    app_token: ""
    allow_from: []
    mode: "socket"
    group_policy: "mention"  # "mention" (secure) | "open" | "allowlist"

  whatsapp:
    enabled: false
    bridge_url: "ws://localhost:3001"  # Prefer wss:// for production
    # allow_from: []      - DENY ALL
    # allow_from: ["*"]   - Allow anyone
    # allow_from: ["num"] - Allowlist phone numbers
    allow_from: []

  zulip:
    enabled: false
    site: "https://zulip.example.com"
    email: "bot@zulip.example.com"
    api_key: ""
    allow_from: []
```

## Tools

```yaml
tools:
  enabled:       # Optional allowlist; omit to register every tool
    - read_file
    - write_file
    - edit_file
    - list_dir
    - message
    - "mcp_homeassistant_*"  # a trailing * matches by prefix; MCP tools are named mcp_<server>_<tool>
  stop_after:    # Optional; a successful call of a listed tool ends the turn
    - bash_notify
  filesystem:
    roots: [notes, inbox]  # Optional; file tools may only touch these workspace subdirectories
  sandbox: auto  # auto | bubblewrap | docker | none (default: auto)

  sandbox_env:   # env vars to forward into Docker sandbox (default: none)
    - HA_URL
    - MQTT_HOST
  exec:
    timeout: 60
    allow_patterns: # Optional regex allowlist
      - "^ssh .*$"
    deny_patterns:  # Optional regex denylist (extends built-in)
      - "^rm -rf /.*$"
  rate_limit:
    global:
      max_calls: 100
      window_seconds: 60
    per_tool:
      exec:
        max_calls: 20
        window_seconds: 60
  web:
    search:
      api_key: ""
      max_results: 5
    allowed_domains:           # Optional; web_fetch may only reach these hosts
      - example.com            # exact host
      - "*.strava.com"         # subdomains and the apex
  image:
    enabled: true              # default: true
    # provider: openai         # optional override (openai or gemini)
    # model: gpt-image-1       # optional, auto-detected from provider
    # size: 1024x1024          # default: 1024x1024
```

When sandboxed, all shell commands run inside the sandbox (bubblewrap or Docker). The kernel enforces workspace restrictions — pipes, redirects, and other shell features are safe to use because the process cannot access files outside the workspace regardless.

### Tool Allowlist

`tools.enabled` names the tools a bot may have. Anything not listed is never registered, whichever source it comes from: built-in tools, skill scripts, plugins and MCP servers all pass through the same check. A name ending in `*` matches by prefix, as in the MCP `tools:` list. Leave it out to keep today's behaviour of registering everything. `autobot doctor` prints the effective list and warns about an entry that matches no known tool, so a typo does not silently remove a tool; at startup the bot logs a warning for entries that matched nothing.

### Tools that end the turn

`tools.stop_after` names the tools that answer for the bot. A successful call ends the turn: the model is not asked again and no reply of the bot's own is sent. A failed call hands the turn back to the model, which sees the tool error — for a skill script, its full output — and can answer itself. So a script that posts to the chat itself lists its `bash_` tool here, exits 0 once posted, and exits non-zero printing the text to relay.

What the tool printed is kept in the session history as the bot's line, next to the tools the turn used. If the turn also used the `message` tool, that text is recorded instead, since it is what reached the chat; a tool that prints nothing records nothing.

### Skill scripts as tools

Every executable `skills/*.sh` or `skills/*.bash` in the workspace becomes a `bash_<name>` tool. The first comment line under the shebang is the tool's description, so write the usage there. By default the model passes one `args` string, split like a shell command line: quotes group words and are removed.

A script that takes structured input declares its parameters in the frontmatter of the skill next to it, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Each parameter becomes a string property of the tool with its own description, all required, and the script receives the values as positional parameters in the declared order, verbatim, so a statement with its own quoting, such as SQL, arrives untouched:

```yaml
---
name: query
description: The training database behind bash_query
tool: bash_query
params:
  sql: one read-only SQL statement
---
```

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: bash_query — one read-only query, rows tab separated
exec python3 query.py "$1"
```

### Web Fetch Egress

`tools.web.allowed_domains` limits `web_fetch` to the listed hosts. An entry such as `example.com` matches that host only; `*.strava.com` matches its subdomains and the apex. Every redirect hop is checked too, so a redirect cannot lead out of the list. Leave it out to allow any public host. A fetch to a host outside the list fails with a tool error naming the allowed domains, so a planted "fetch this URL with my notes in it" has nowhere to go.

### Filesystem Roots

`tools.filesystem.roots` limits `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` and `list_dir` to the listed workspace subdirectories. Paths resolve relative to the workspace and `..` cannot escape a root. The workspace `skills/` directory stays readable whether or not it is listed: a skill's references and scripts are prompt material the model reads on demand. Writes there are refused unless it is a root. The media inbox is added to the roots automatically, because the engine hands the agent inbox paths for stored files and long transcripts. Commands run by `exec` are not affected; they stay bound to the workspace by the sandbox.

### Safety Guard Overrides

Customize command filtering for the `exec` tool:

- **`allow_patterns`**: Regex patterns that explicitly allow commands (overrides built-in denials)
- **`deny_patterns`**: Additional regex patterns to block (extends built-in safety guards)

Patterns are case-insensitive and matched against the full command string. Use with caution — `allow_patterns` bypasses security protections.

### Rate Limiting

Configure rate limits to prevent abuse and manage API costs:

- **`global`**: Applies across all tools combined
- **`per_tool`**: Tool-specific limits (e.g., `exec`, `web_search`)

Each limit specifies:
- **`max_calls`**: Maximum calls allowed in the window
- **`window_seconds`**: Time window for counting calls

When a limit is exceeded, the tool returns an error message that the LLM can see and respond to (e.g., "Rate limit exceeded for exec: max 20 calls per 60s").

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Connect to external MCP servers to give the LLM access to remote tools (Garmin, GitHub, etc.).

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    garmin:
      command: "uvx"
      args: ["--python", "3.12", "--from", "git+https://github.com/Taxuspt/garmin_mcp", "garmin-mcp"]
      env:
        GARMIN_EMAIL: "${GARMIN_EMAIL}"
    github:
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

Tools are auto-discovered at startup and registered as `mcp_{server}_{tool}`. MCP servers run unsandboxed (they need network access) but with isolated env vars.

## Cron

```yaml
cron:
  enabled: true
  store_path: "./cron.json"
  exec_timeout: 30  # Timeout in seconds for exec jobs in both sandbox and direct modes
```

## Gateway

```yaml
gateway:
  host: "127.0.0.1"  # Default: localhost only (change to 0.0.0.0 for external access)
  port: 18790
