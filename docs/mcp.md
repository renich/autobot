# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Autobot can connect to external MCP servers to extend the LLM's capabilities with remote tools. MCP servers expose tools via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio — autobot discovers them at startup and registers them as regular tools so the LLM can use them transparently.

## How It Works

1. On startup, autobot reads the `mcp.servers` section from `config.yml`
2. All servers are started **in the background** — they do not block startup
3. For each server, it spawns the command as a child process
4. Performs the MCP protocol handshake (initialize + notifications/initialized)
5. Calls `tools/list` to discover available tools
6. Registers each tool as `mcp_{server}_{tool}` in the tool registry
7. The LLM sees these as native tools and can call them like any other

Since MCP servers connect asynchronously, tools become available shortly after startup rather than delaying it. Multiple servers are started concurrently.

## Configuration

Add an `mcp` section to your `config.yml`:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    garmin:
      command: "uvx"
      args: ["--python", "3.12", "--from", "git+https://github.com/Taxuspt/garmin_mcp", "garmin-mcp"]
      env:
        GARMIN_EMAIL: "${GARMIN_EMAIL}"
        GARMIN_PASSWORD: "${GARMIN_PASSWORD}"
    github:
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

Each server entry has:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `command` | string | Executable to spawn (must be in PATH) |
| `args` | string[] | Command-line arguments |
| `env` | map | Environment variables passed to the process |
| `tools` | string[] | Tool allowlist (empty = all). Supports `*` prefix matching |

Environment variables support `${VAR}` expansion from your `.env` file or shell environment.

## Tool Naming

MCP tools are prefixed to avoid collisions with built-in tools:

```
mcp_{server_name}_{tool_name}
```

All characters outside `[a-z0-9_]` are replaced with underscores. For example:

| Server | Remote Tool | Registered As |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| garmin | get_activities | `mcp_garmin_get_activities` |
| github | list-repos | `mcp_github_list_repos` |

## Security

MCP servers run as regular child processes (not sandboxed) because they typically need network access for external APIs. However, several safeguards are in place:

- **Env isolation**: Only explicitly configured env vars are passed to the process, plus `PATH`, `HOME`, and `LANG` from the host
- **No workspace sharing**: MCP processes do not receive access to autobot's workspace directory
- **Timeouts**: 30s for initialization handshake, 60s for tool calls
- **Response truncation**: Tool results are capped at 50KB to prevent memory issues
- **No auto-restart**: If a server crashes, its tools return errors until autobot is restarted

## Tool errors

A server reports a failing tool by answering normally with `isError` set. Autobot honours that
flag: the call becomes a tool error, the agent is told it failed, and the message is logged at
warning level.

Not every server sets it. Some return the upstream API's error as ordinary content with no flag,
and autobot cannot tell that apart from a successful answer — the agent reads the error text and
decides what to do. When a tool looks like it succeeded but nothing changed, check what the agent
was actually told rather than trusting the absence of a warning in the log.

## Troubleshooting

### Server fails to start

Check that the command is installed and in your PATH:

```bash
which uvx   # or npx, or whatever command you configured
```

Enable debug logging to see stderr output from MCP servers:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug autobot agent -m "test"
```

### Tools not discovered

Verify the server responds to the MCP protocol. You can test manually:

```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"0.1.0"}}}' | npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
```

### Timeouts

Request execution is bounded by timeouts (30s for the initialization handshake, 60s for tool calls). If a tool call times out, the server remains running and subsequent tool calls proceed normally; late responses arriving after the deadline are automatically discarded so the stdio stream stays synchronized.

If a server takes longer than 30s to initialize or fails the protocol handshake, Autobot terminates the process immediately to prevent leaked background processes. Pre-install dependencies before running autobot:

```bash
# For Python-based servers
uvx --python 3.12 --from git+https://... garmin-mcp --help

# For Node-based servers
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github --help
```
